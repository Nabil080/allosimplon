# AlloSimplon

My first fullstack dynamic website:
A movie catalog featuring user authentication, search/sort/filter options, user ratings, likes, discussions, and a full admin CRUD system.

## Usage

I updated the project to use Docker since it was hard to replicate my old environment.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Admin account

- **Email**: [admin@admin.admin](mailto:admin@admin.admin)
- **Password**: admin

This account gives access to the administrator interface and full CRUD: managing accounts, movies, comments...

## Functionalities

### Global
